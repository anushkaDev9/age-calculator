# age-calculator
### The challenge
The  challenge is to build out a tip calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
Users should be able to:
-View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
Receive validation errors if:
 - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
 - The day number is not between 1-31
 - The month number is not between 1-12
 - The date is in the future
 - The date is invalid, e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Built with
- HTML5
- JavaScript
- CSS
### What I learned
- form validation<br/>
- dom elements b<r/>
- css properties.
